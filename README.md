Overall, I found this to be an engaging technical challenge that allowed me to demonstrate capabilities across both systems engineering and web development domains. I began with the WebAssembly challenge to showcase my ability to work with low-level systems integration while maintaining web compatibility.
During implementation, I encountered initial build configuration challenges with WebAssembly compilation, specifically around dependency version compatibility and proper wasm-pack setup. After debugging, I successfully achieved a working build pipeline.

Time allocation became a constraint when I invested more effort than planned in the task orchestration challenge, which impacted my ability to fully complete all WebAssembly requirements. Below is my assessment of areas for improvement in each challenge:

Challenge 2 (WASM)

1. Optimize wasm build by adding proper wasm-pack configs (lto = true, opt-level = "s", codegen-units = 1, panic = "abort")
2. Better javascript demo (proper async WASM initialization patterns, better error handling ensuring JS has access to rust errors, browser compatible console logging)
3. Error handling (convert all unwrap() calls to proper Result returns, use JsValue for JavaScript-friendly errors)
4. Performance profiling demonstration (WASM bundle size analysis, runtime benchmarking of crypto operations vs pure JS, memory usage profiling)
5. Make sure bitcoin/crypto specific libraries have synergy with eachother / build our own.

Challenge 3 (Task orchestration)

1. Add proper signal handling (SIGTERM, SIGINT) for graceful shutdown instead of relying only on broadcast channels
2. Implement retry logic with exponential backoff for transient failures rather than immediate fail-fast
3. Add structured logging with correlation IDs and JSON output for production monitoring
4. Implement timeout handling for individual tasks with configurable duration limits
5. Add health check endpoints and metrics collection (task duration, success rates)
6. Separate task definitions into their own modules with configurable parameters via config file
7. Add integration tests with real external dependencies and chaos engineering scenarios
8. Implement proper resource pooling and cleanup verification in shutdown sequence
